    const Xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();
    
    const requestUrl='https://api.github.com/users/ShivamSingh321GO';
    Xhr.open('GET',requestUrl,true);//here true means : the api call will be asynchronous and by default is also Asynchronous , but if we set it false the api call will be synchronous and will block the callstack therfore it is not recommended learn more about it from chatgpt
    Xhr.onreadystatechange=function(){
        console.log(Xhr.readyState);
        if(Xhr.readyState==4){
            // console.log(this.responseText);
            const data=JSON.parse(this.responseText);//data obje response will be in string form  therefore convert it into json obj
            console.log(data.followers);
            //followers will be 0 in the output
