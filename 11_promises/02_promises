     /**
     NoTE: 1.Here the thing to notice is that the data from fetch fn. is printed first compared to the promise made by me, 
            also the promise made by me written at the top of the fetch fn promise.
            
            2.it is happening because we studied in namastey js that there two queues one is task queue(callback queue) and one 
            is message queue , the message queue has higher priority than task queue.

            3.message queue only takes the functions of fetch api and task queue takes setTimeout and other apis functions,
              therefore due to  higher priority of the fetchAPI method its data is printed first compared to promise resolved
              using setTimeout fn.
